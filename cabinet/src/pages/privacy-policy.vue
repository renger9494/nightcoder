      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
        information is protected both online and offline.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
        transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your
        web browser, or look for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.
        <br />
        <br />
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information
        offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
        service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store
        personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain
        reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the
        information we store, to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is
        100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected
        from you.
      </p>

      <h2>Orders</h2>
      <p>
        We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like
        e-mail) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for
        billing purposes and to fill out your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information
        to contact you.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us
